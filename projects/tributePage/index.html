      <h1>Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam</h1>
      <h2>Great Indian scientist and
				politician who played a leading
				role in the development of India’s
				missile and nuclear weapons
				programs.</h2>
      
        <ul>
          <li>
              A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, in full Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam, was born on <b>October 15, 1931</b>, in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu, India.
          </li>
          <li>
              He served as the <b>11th</b> President of India from <b>2002</b> to <b>2007</b>.
          </li>
          <li>
              Kalam earned a degree in aeronautical engineering from the Madras Institute of Technology and in <b>1958</b> joined the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO).
          </li>
          <li>
              In <b>1969</b>, he moved to the Indian Space Research Organisation, where he was project director of the SLV-III, the first satellite launch vehicle that was both designed and produced in India.
          </li>
          <li>
              Rejoining DRDO in <b>1982</b>, Kalam planned the program that produced a number of successful missiles, which helped earn him the nickname <strong>“Missile Man.”</strong>
          </li>
          <li>
              Among those successes was Agni, India’s first intermediate-range ballistic missile, which incorporated aspects of the SLV-III and was launched in <b>1989</b>.
          </li>
          <li>
              He also played a pivotal organisational, technical, and political role in India's Pokhran-II nuclear tests in <b>1998</b>, the first since the original nuclear test by India in <b>1974</b>.
          </li>
          <li>
              From <b>1992</b> to <b>1997</b> Kalam was scientific adviser to the defense minister, and he later served as principal scientific adviser (<b>1999–2001</b>) to the government with the rank of cabinet minister.
          </li>
          <li>
              His prominent role in the country’s <b>1998</b> nuclear weapons tests solidified India as a nuclear power and established Kalam as a national hero, although the tests caused great concern in the international community.
          </li>
          <li>
              In <b>1998</b> Kalam put forward a countrywide plan called Technology Vision <b>2020</b>, which he described as a road map for transforming India from a less-developed to a developed society in 20 years. The plan called for, among other measures, increasing agricultural productivity, emphasizing technology as a vehicle for economic growth, and widening access to health care and education.
          </li>
          <li>
              Kalam received <b>7</b> honorary doctorates from <b>40</b> universities. The Government of India honoured him with the <b>Padma Bhushan in 1981</b> and the <b>Padma Vibhushan in 1990</b> for his work with <b>ISRO and DRDO </b> and his role as a scientific adviser to the Government.
          </li>
          <li>
              In <b>1997</b>, Kalam received India's highest civilian honour, the Bharat Ratna, for his contribution to scientific research and modernisation of defence technology in India.
          </li>
          <li>
              In <b>2013</b>, he was the recipient of the Von Braun Award from the National Space Society "to recognize excellence in the management and leadership of a space-related project".
          </li>
          <li>
              While delivering a lecture at the Indian Institute of Management Shillong, Kalam collapsed and died from an apparent cardiac arrest on <b>27 July 2015</b>, aged <b>83</b>.
          </li>
          <li>
              Wheeler Island, a national missile test site in Odisha, was renamed <b>Kalam Island</b> in September <b>2015</b>.
          </li>
          <li>
              A prominent road in New Delhi was renamed from Aurangzeb Road to Dr APJ Abdul Kalam Road in <b>August 2015</b>.
          </li>
          <li>
              In February <b>2018</b>, scientists from the Botanical Survey of India named a newly found plant species as Drypetes kalamii, in his honour.
